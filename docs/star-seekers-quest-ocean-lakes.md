# PART 2: THE TREASURE HUNT

### The Story
*Long ago, three wise navigators followed a star across the seas. Before reaching their destination, they hid clues along this very shore for future seekers. Now YOUR crew must follow their ancient path, collecting the sacred treasures they left behind. Each clue brings you closer to where the Star leads... to the greatest gift ever given.*

---

## Hunt Structure
- **Duration**: ~1 hour (8 stops)
- **Style**: Cooperative (all kids in 2 golf carts work together)
- **Format**: Clue at each location leads to next; collect a small item/symbol at each stop
- **Final Destination**: Return to home base for Nativity assembly + prize

---

## How It Works (iPhone-Based)

**Mackenzie** is the Clue Keeper. She holds her iPhone and receives each clue via text message.

**An adult** (the "Clue Sender") pre-loads all 8 clues and sends each one ONLY after the group:
1. Arrives at the correct location
2. Finds the hidden item
3. Confirms they're ready for the next clue

### Setup Options:

**Option A - Scheduled Messages (Best)**
- Pre-schedule all clues in iMessage (iOS 18+) or use the Shortcuts app
- Adult triggers each send when ready

**Option B - Notes App**
- Adult keeps all clues in Notes app
- Copy/paste each clue to Mackenzie when ready

**Option C - Group Text Thread**
- Create group with Mackenzie
- Adult sends clues one at a time

---

## Materials Needed (Prep Before Hunt)

### Items to Hide at Each Location:
1. **Gold coin** (chocolate gold coin or painted rock) - GOLD from Magi
2. **Small bottle of essential oil or spice jar** - FRANKINCENSE
3. **Small decorative bottle** - MYRRH
4. **Paper/wooden star** - THE STAR
5. **Small figurine or printed image of Mary**
6. **Small figurine or printed image of Joseph**
7. **Small manger/hay bundle**

4. **Take photos** at each stop for memories
5. **End with hot cocoa** and reading Luke 2:1-20 as you assemble the Nativity
